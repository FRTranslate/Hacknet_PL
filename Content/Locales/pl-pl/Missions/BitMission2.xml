Alright! If you see this, then you've done well and... well, all this might actually be worth something.
Is that too much to hope for? It seems like a lot to hope for.

I've realized that I just don't have time to write this whole thing - there's way too much to learn, and I don't have time to do any of it. So, I'm going to need to ask something more. 

There's a group that goes by 'Entropy' that's currently accepting members. They'll be able to teach you more. When you're ready, I'll contact you again.
As for getting into Entropy, you'll need to bypass a proxy server - a few shells (open using the command "shell") running on computers you've already got admin access on should be able to overload it.

Good luck...
and thankyou,

P.S: I almost forgot, if you run into trouble, I've linked the network education archives server too - it's got a lot of useful info on it.

Run shells on computers you have admin access to with "Shell".

Connect to a target computer, probe it's security.

Use the shells to overload target proxy.

NetEdu Archives will have more details.
