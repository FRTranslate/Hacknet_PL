Handy list of commands you'll want from the command line :

cat [filename] - brings up the text output of the filename specified

cd / - drops you to the root directory of the file system

ls - outputs the directory and files in the dir that you're in

cd .. - pulls you up one level from where you are

replace [filename] "[string1]" "[string2]" - replaces the specified content of the target file (String 1) with the stuff you want to replace it with (string 2)

mv [filename] [target] - moves OR renames a file, if you want to move the file, you need to specify the folder you want to move it to like this -

mv config.sys /misc/

if you want to rename the file, then simply specify the string that you want the file to be renamed to such as 

mv config.sys config.old

Help 1, Help 2, Help 3 - The help file, all three pages. Read and absorb.

forkbomb - It's not specified, but it's a useful panic button if you need to down a system in a hurry, you'll need admin rights for this one, you CAN forkbomb your own system as a defensive measure

shell - sets up a remote host on a system where you've admin access, this CAN be run on your own system as a defensive measure (See "Trap" for details)

[jwalter] Don't forget to clear the browser history, we don't want him tracing it back to us.

[jwalter] Okay, give me a minute to set up the camera feed.....
[jwalter] Good to go. You got three minutes before that static image falls down.
[shinterland] I'll take the list, then we'll grab a pint to celebrate.
